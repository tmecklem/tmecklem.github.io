Don't sacrifice testability, simplicity, and joy over scalability (in either direction) until you _actually_ have the problem that needs them. If you get some scalability for free, great (thanks, Elixir!). But it's a great big YAGNI for most endeavors. Microservices, k8s, cloud functions, I'm looking at you.

AI has done something to my eye for code. I find myself caring less about how the code looks, but I care even more about how the overall design and cohesiveness of the application looks. The "beautiful code" doesn't really matter any more as long as I can see the big pieces fitting well. Although I wasn't around for the move from assembly to C, it feels like a similar point unveiling in our journey of software development. Just like very few people care about what the machine code looks like for their applications, I think we're asymptotically moving toward a place where opening the code editor is an escape hatch and not a regular destination (for certain kinds of software development anyway).

I don't know how I feel about that, and I guess honestly it can't really matter that much how I feel. Just a Monday morning observation.

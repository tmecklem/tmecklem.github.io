I beat myself up when I make mistakes. I obsess over details of events past, present and future, even though I know that there are diminishing returns. I've re-read this post 14 times so far. I'm not alone in this behavior. Perfectionists of the world understand me.

What I didn't know until recently: it's possible to take this behavior and the resulting introspection to a very unhealthy extreme. The damage from packing on this burden daily can be extensive and difficult to reverse. Over the course of 2013, I allowed myself down this path, and I'm still very much in the middle of the consequences.

There's no specific beginning to what happened last year. There was, however, a series of events that I can point to that triggered an avalanche of negative thoughts. In the spring, we had a hail storm that damaged our house and one of our cars. The insurance company was willing to cover the replacement of the old aluminum siding on the entire house, so I began the process of searching for a contractor to do the work. You already know that I'm always 3 steps ahead of the here and now, and I fret the details of decisions I may never even have to make. Contractor choices began to wear on me as I juggled meetings at the house with my work responsibilities. 

To enhance my stress, I had just taken on the role of lead developer for the mobile team, so I was anxious to pick up my new responsibilities without missing a beat. The project timelines were highly unreasonable, so I went to all the right meetings and said all the right things to make people aware of the situation. I still pushed myself and my team to complete the improbable, playing the part of a dedicated employee and tidying things up until the eleventh hour. I let poor planning by a whole host of people become my own personal multi-month crisis.

I also began leading a small group at church which required planning and reading, and I was determined to make the program a success. I tried harder at it than I have ever tried in any other leadership endeavor, and I took on the role of leading discussions despite my clear aversions. I questioned my competence as a leader routinely before the meetings.

The straw on the camel's back came in a form smaller than an actual piece of straw. It was an ant. Carpenter ants, to be precise. I came home from work one day to find a winged carpenter ant in the throes of death in my basement near the garage. It was large enough to catch my attention, but I recognized it for what it was and swept it up into the trash. The next day, I found another one in its place. This continued at a constant rate for about a week, and I started to worry. I researched it on the Internet. I convinced myself despite only seeing a few that there was a massive satellite nest in the house somewhere. I visualized the worst case: the slow destruction of my largest investment. I began to do increasingly unreasonable things to find it. I sent cameras into duct work, peeled away access panels, even wore a head lamp with red filter lens on midnight trips around the house trying to find the point of entry for the worker ants sent from the mother nest. I tapped on wood beams, listening for the sound of ant mandibles crunching away at my kingdom. I became obsessed with the idea that I was being invaded by a tiny army. In a very real sense, the handful of dying ants I saw were winning a war they didn't even know they were fighting. The stress I allowed myself to bear at this point was incredible, but it was not apparent to me at the time.

Once the old siding was removed, we found a very small abandoned satellite nest, on the order of a dozen empty ant egg sacs. They hadn't even touched the outer plywood of the house, and I found no tiny drawings of invasion battle plans. To summarize: zero actual damage. All my worst case visualizations were completely without merit. My neighbor subsequently found the main nest in a tree in his back yard and utterly destroyed the source.

For at least 6 months during all this, I let fear reign. I worried about failing in multiple areas of life simultaneously and about physical damage to my possessions. I allowed in a multitude of negative thoughts. The voice of fear spoke one thing clearly in quiet moments. It said, "everything is broken". I had no area of my life that I felt was a place of rest. The people I relied on for answers seemed to have none. My closest friends shrugged off my concerns without knowing how deeply invested I was.

The reason why the brokenness argument is so effective against my rational mind is that it's true. We are all broken. The things we build, whether software or houses or siding or cars, they are all broken in some way. For me, the very thought that everything is broken is actually one of the ways in which I've been broken. It's meta-brokenness. In keeping with his style, Satan can masterfully spin this half-truth into a feeling of hopelessness. 

But it's not the complete picture.

In the brokenness around me, I see that there is a plan for redemption. In my own brokenness, I am being humbled and formed into something I couldn't have been before last year. My relationship with God is stronger and I recognize my need for Him.

title: "Hot take: Design Patterns has fallen out of favor in recent times, but I value the time I spent with it. It taught me to think about code problems in a systematic way… that's it's not just about delivering software that works, but rather about delivering a set of capabilities that can be reasoned about and re-molded based on the need and shape of the problem at hand. The patterns may be dated and superseded by material more suited to modern tools and languages, but I appreciated what this book did for me in my early career."

Hot take: Design Patterns has fallen out of favor in recent times, but I value the time I spent with it. It taught me to think about code problems in a systematic way… that’s it’s not just about delivering software that works, but rather about delivering a set of capabilities that can be reasoned about and re-molded based on the need and shape of the problem at hand. The patterns may be dated and superseded by material more suited to modern tools and languages, but I appreciated what this book did for me in my early career.

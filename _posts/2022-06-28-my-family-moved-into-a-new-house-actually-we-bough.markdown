My family moved into a new house (actually we bought my parents' house) last year. When we did that we also got a large, inground pool! I've become much better at applied chemistry from this experience ðŸ˜….

One thing that is related both to my pool and the Launch Scout team is the need for continual adjustment. When the chemistry of the pool is off, getting it back into balance is a complex dance of multiple factors like free and combined chlorine levels, ph and alkalinity, and water clarity. If factors that lead to imbalance are caught early, returning the balance is easy with small corrections. If I let it go a day too long, it's a much longer and trickier process to get things back to good.

My team also knows this, and we incorporate lots of small and large feedback loops into our work to stay balanced and focused. We have daily standups, regular retrospectives, and we all shoulder the work to build shared understanding of the objectives. We set our sights on the long term and make minor corrections along the way to stay on track.

One major benefit of these small changes is cost savings. A pool out of balance can cost a _lot_ of money in chemicals. A team that adapts and practices agility can save a lot of wasted time and energy by "doing the wrong thing for the least amount of time possible".

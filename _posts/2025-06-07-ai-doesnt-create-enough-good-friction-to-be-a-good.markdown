AI doesn’t create enough good friction to be a good pair.

Some of my best ideas come during synchronous collaboration. Often times in the past, the point of which this happened was during pair programming. Here’s the thing though: most of my terrible ideas came up during those sessions as well. When I had a human to pair with, they could rein me in and proactively tell me when I was nuts. AI doesn’t do that. Not only will it happily go about implementing my terrible ideas, but it’ll make up a few of its own. Maybe this is just a prompt thing, but the compliance of AI during a “pairing” session creates too little friction sometimes.

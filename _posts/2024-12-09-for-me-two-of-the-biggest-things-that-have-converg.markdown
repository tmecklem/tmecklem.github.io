For me, two of the biggest things that have converged and shaped me as a developer: learning to ship everything I do in the smallest form possible iteratively, and being more stubborn than the software.

Sometimes people ask what it took for me to be a successful software developer, expecting wisdom about picking tech stacks or leet coding or whatever. But I think that those two things formed inside me to become a relentless force... throwing one brick on top of another and the willingness to recognize that I built the wrong thing and tearing everything down to start over without being crushed by it. I think that defines every successful software project I've done more than the code, tools, or process things people typically talk about.

Hey, everyone! I'll be in Atlanta at the Connect.Tech conference November 8th and 9th to talk about Designing Real-time Web Applications (https://lnkd.in/ehGceEB2)

If you will be in the area or know anyone in the area who wants to talk shop over coffee, let me know! I'm excited to meet some people in the Atlanta tech community!

Cursor is a protyping beast.

One of my own professional strengths over my career is being able to prototype and think quickly to understand new problems and problem spaces. When I’m learning about a new tool, I dig in immediately and begin to play and break it, which frustrates a lot of people who prefer a structured approach of reading documentation. I tend to get something working quickly, and then go back and understand what I did that could be improved.

With these tools now I can jump into an area I’ve never been in and quickly get a grasp of what it’s capable of, which helps me make very fast decisions about which technologies to apply or pass on.

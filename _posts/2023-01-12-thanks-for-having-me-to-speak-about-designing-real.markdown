Thanks for having me to speak about designing real time web applications, #codemash! Here are the results of the interactive polls during the talk. The first two helped me and the room to know what roles and technologies were represented in the audience. The last one was a (hidden) poll that helped me to know whether I hit the mark with my talk.

Special thank you to Launch Scout and Katie Pohlman for supporting me in preparation for this. I appreciate all of you!

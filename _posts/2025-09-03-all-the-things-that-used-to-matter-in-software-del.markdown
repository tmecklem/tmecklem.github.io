title: "All the things that used to matter in software delivery matter even more now. That has been one of the most fun realizations this year. If your process was lightweight before, you can move faster now with LLM tooling. If your processes held you back before, they will hold you back more than ever. Same for tests (or lack thereof), team education and cohesiveness, revenue insights, you name it. We have just given ourselves a faster vehicle. If we’re already moving in the right direction, we get there much faster. If everyone’s steering in a different direction… we’ll hit the wall faster and sooner than ever."

All the things that used to matter in software delivery matter even more now. That has been one of the most fun realizations this year. If your process was lightweight before, you can move faster now with LLM tooling. If your processes held you back before, they will hold you back more than ever. Same for tests (or lack thereof), team education and cohesiveness, revenue insights, you name it. We have just given ourselves a faster vehicle. If we’re already moving in the right direction, we get there much faster. If everyone’s steering in a different direction… we’ll hit the wall faster and sooner than ever.

We are both beneficiaries and victims of this at Launch Scout. But our eyes are open and we are more aware than ever of the effects of our decisions, because the feedback loops are getting shorter, and cause-and-effect is becoming more directly observable.

If this doesn’t feel true to you, or you feel more and more frustrated as time goes on that things don’t seem to be showing the results you’re seeing other people get on a platform like LinkedIn, keep at the important stuff. And reach out. I’m an open book.

Putting other considerations aside for a moment, I'm awestruck at how fluidly I can move into spaces that would have taken much deeper research and learning before Claude and friends. In the timespan of a couple of days, I've been able to build a Windows-executable Elixir application that uses websockets, starts on login, and manages some complex process lifecycles. Additionally, it has an NSIS installer. It's likely this software would have never been built a year ago due to the amount of time it would have taken me to get up to speed on all of that, and not only does it exist now, it has a full test harness, is part of a CI build process, and is in production use. I read every line of code for all 70+ files in the PR, I understand what it's doing and how it's doing it, and it has opened a door that would have been shut in the past. Let the AI coding debate rage on as it will, and we'll just be over here in the corner building crazy new stuff we only dreamed about before.

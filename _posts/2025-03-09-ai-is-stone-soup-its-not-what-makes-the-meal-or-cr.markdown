title: "AI is stone soup. It’s not what makes the meal or creates anything meaningful by itself. Oftentimes in my recent experiences, it’s merely a sociological catalyst just as the traveler used the stone to encourage people to contribute. There is still a fundamental need for people to apply your experience and knowledge together. We all still have to bring our unique talents and abilities to the table, and we have different things to contribute that are valuable and necessary for our work to be complete."

AI is stone soup. It’s not what makes the meal or creates anything meaningful by itself. Oftentimes in my recent experiences, it’s merely a sociological catalyst just as the traveler used the stone to encourage people to contribute. There is still a fundamental need for people to apply your experience and knowledge together. We all still have to bring our unique talents and abilities to the table, and we have different things to contribute that are valuable and necessary for our work to be complete.

Anyone selling you fear does not have your best interest at heart. Don’t buy it. The uncertainty of the future will fade, and we will once again find balance, maybe with a little more recognition of our humanity than ever.

The goal... was to make the industry better." I love Rob Tarr's words and Sparkbox's actions around their apprenticeship program. I've got a lot respect for what you've built, Sparkbox!

I remember trying to shape my own mental model of a successful apprenticeship program 7-8 years ago by peppering Ryan Cromwell with questions after midnight during a weekend at Southwest Ohio Give Camp. That remains as a standout moment for me in my early days at Launch Scout.

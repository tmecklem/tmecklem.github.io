# Windows and Elixir—An Unexpected Joy

## Blog Post

There are a lot of reasons this post shouldn't exist. Microsoft historically tried to take out Linux, but their work on the Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) is impressive. Due to the pandemic and a client project, the author found himself using a desktop PC instead of his MacBook Pro.

Despite the odds, the author grew to appreciate the "Windows + Linux" setup, finding it versatile and powerful for software development. After building a multicore machine with a Ryzen 3900X processor and 32 GB of RAM, he installed WSL 2 with Ubuntu 20.04.

Key highlights of his experience:
- Set up development environment using asdf-vm, PostgreSQL, Elixir, and Ruby
- Used Spacemacs with VcXsrv for X server support
- Discovered VS Code's excellent remote WSL development capabilities
- Experienced significant performance improvements in build tasks

The author was particularly impressed by the build speed for Nerves systems, which were much faster compared to his MacBook Pro. He has since been using WSL 2 full-time while supporting a Windows IT environment.

His conclusion: WSL 2 provides a solid basis for Elixir development on Windows, to the point where he hasn't even set up the planned Linux dual boot.

Did you know you can teach AI to speak your company's language?

One of my emerging happy paths in using AI development tools is to build DSLs (domain specific languages) that let us code in the same vernacular as the business problems we're solving. DSLs aren't new at all, but building them is much easier now, and it also gives the AI tools ongoing guidance about how to interact with the system within the guardrails of the language.

If that's too technical or abstract, just imagine that you can teach the AI to develop code that sounds less like, "put this JSON data here, retrieve it and display it to the user there" and more like, "take my TPS reports from Tuesday and notify the administrator via the sync-up dashboard".

If you're interested in knowing more about how we can write code that looks like how you talk about your business, I'm happy to show you more 1-1. Message me!

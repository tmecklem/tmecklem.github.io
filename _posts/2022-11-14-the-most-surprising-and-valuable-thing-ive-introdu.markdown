It helps me to tailor the talk to the audience, see what technologies are in active use, and get a sense of whether I hit the mark in the content.

The most surprising and valuable thing I've introduced since speaking at conferences again is interactive polls. Here are the results of the most recent talk I gave at Connect.Tech. It helps me to tailor the talk to the audience, see what technologies are in active use, and get a sense of whether I hit the mark in the content. The first two are shown live in the slides as people engage, and the feedback question is hidden to allow people to be candid in their feedback.

It's surprising how many people have been willing to engage, and valuable in that I can adapt and learn. Someone asked me where to get their session's feedback score and I had to disappoint them by telling them that it wasn't a conference-organized poll. Just a one-off I'm going to keep doing. Thanks for the inspiration from your ElixirConf talk, Kimberly Johnson!

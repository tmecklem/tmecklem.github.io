## Blog Post Content

I first became familiar with Gaslight when I attended QCMerge in April 2013. At the time, I was an iOS developer working in a large enterprise Java environment, and my interest in software development was waning due to heavy processes and politics.

QCMerge opened my eyes to Cincinnati's tech community. I started attending Gaslight Coffee on Fridays, where I met entrepreneurial people discussing various topics. When a developer position opened up, I was interested.

### What I Expected About Gaslight

I anticipated:
- An uncompromising focus on quality
- Constant pairing
- Test-driven development
- Foosball and Nerf battles
- Continuous delivery
- Well-defined projects and stories
- Autonomous teams with a consistent approach

### What I Actually Experienced

**Quality and Collaboration**
- Genuine commitment to quality
- Pairing happens, though not universally
- Obsession with testing the right things
- Smart colleagues who challenge each other

**Work Culture**
- Consistently ships software
- Empowers team members to ask difficult questions
- Protects team members' time
- Open and transparent about company operations
- Autonomous teams with flexible problem-solving approaches

**Fun and Recreation**
- Foosball is common for unwinding
- No random Nerf battles during work
- Recreation has its place, separate from work

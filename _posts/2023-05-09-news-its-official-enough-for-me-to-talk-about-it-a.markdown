News! It's official enough for me to talk about it at this point:

I finished my MBA with a concentration in Values Based Leadership from Xavier University - Williams College of Business.

I'll be graduating with a 4.0 and was inducted into the Beta Gamma Sigma honor society last week. Engineering undergrad Tim wouldn't recognize graduate student Tim. Wildly different study habits, dedication, and GPA ðŸ˜‚.

This represents 4 years of work spanning a pandemic and countless other setbacks and life changes. I gave up personal and family time to get here, and I'm thankful for the support I've received. I'm excited to invest my time back into those areas. My professional goal remains: to continue quietly going about the business of helping my colleagues and company, Launch Scout.

In this small moment, it's time to celebrate the accomplishment a little!

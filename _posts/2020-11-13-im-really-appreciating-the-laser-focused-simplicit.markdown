I'm really appreciating the laser-focused simplicity that Phoenix and LiveView afford in just _getting work done_. Reminds me of the days before heavy frontend js, but without having to give up that real-time, rich interaction we've all come to expect from web and mobile apps. It's a huge opportunity for building a competitive advantage in new product developments, and I haven't been this excited about a framework since Java Spring came along to simplify the mess of J2EE over a decade ago. If you are evaluating a technical stack decision, hit me up. I can give you some solid points to consider that might influence your choice based on productivity, speed, and maintainability. #productivity #frontend #building

Feeling a little left behind with all the hyped or deeply-technical AI posts on here? I wrote an article for you: https://lnkd.in/gxPrDWqQ

I have had a healthy dose of skepticism on the benefits of modern AI tools for while, not just back to the early LLMs but even further to my CS degree coursework. In between my skepticism and the FOMO hyperbole you're probably seeing, there’s a path to use some of these tools pragmatically. I decided to write the first of a short series of articles on some of the practical everyday things I’m using recent AI tools to do at Launch Scout, for some of our clients, and at home.

Hopefully you can benefit from it, and please share your own uses in the comments!

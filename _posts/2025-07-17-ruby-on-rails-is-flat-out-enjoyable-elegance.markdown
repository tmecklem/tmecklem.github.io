Ruby on Rails is flat out enjoyable elegance.

It's rare to get to see the same exact application built in two languages. I have that rare privilege, and one of those implementations is Ruby. There's such a vast difference in the elegance and simplicity of the Ruby and Rails version of this app vs the other one. Both are using "best practices" in their respective stacks, and the Ruby app is imminently approachable, readable, and friendly. The specs tell the story of how it should behave, and everything in the app reads like a series of poems or short stories instead of dense reference material like the other. Sometimes it's easy to forget about the elegance of Ruby when it's a daily driver.

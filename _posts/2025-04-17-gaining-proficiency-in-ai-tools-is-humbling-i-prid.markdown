Gaining proficiency in AI tools is humbling. I pride myself on being a scrappy problem-solving kind of person, but the necessary amount of continuous curiosity and lateral thinking that's required to be successful is pretty high. To do novel things with novels tools, you have to show up every time you open the tool, and it shows in the results the moment you go on cruise control (even if you don't notice it until you go to merge a PR or send a message AI helped you write).

It's like being on a "tiger team" of you and the AI every session. That can be a hard adjustment, but the payoff is big if you put in the effort.

Continuing on in my recent Elixir #livebook adventures... I used #Nx linear algebra functions to solve a system of equations to find the equilibrium point in an economics supply and demand problem in the same class.

Honestly, I barely remembered the right terms to Google and, 15 minutes later after some learning reminders from my matrix methods class, LiveBook and Nx had my answer and VegaLite had the layered graph showing in the book along the story of the data. Powerful stuff.

title: "The biggest shortcoming of every AI coding/assistant tool I've seen is the inability of the tool to incorporate feedback from when I take the wheel back for a course correction. I have to go all in on chat or take full control and then try desperately to get it to invalidate its internal cache and line of thought. I really want it to be able to see that I've made a change and then use that as feedback for the next actions we take together."

The biggest shortcoming of every AI coding/assistant tool I've seen is the inability of the tool to incorporate feedback from when I take the wheel back for a course correction. I have to go all in on chat or take full control and then try desperately to get it to invalidate its internal cache and line of thought. I really want it to be able to see that I've made a change and then use that as feedback for the next actions we take together.

Does anyone know of a tool or solution in the works for that?

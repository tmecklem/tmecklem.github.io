AI-generated content tastes like preservatives.

You know how when you eat heavily processed food, it has a certain taste? If you're an adult around my age, preservative-laden food probably tastes a little like childhood nostalgia. But it's also not good, and you know it's probably doing bad stuff to your system if you overindulge. That's what I mean. There's a little bit of familiar, a little bit of repulsion, and a nagging subconscious feeling that you shouldn't be consuming too much of it. But the more you consume, the less you notice how it's a little... off.

The world doesn't need you to make a better content prompt. We need your authentic voice and your typos and your unique point-of-view. Build with AI, refine with AI, and ship your thing with AI. But don't lose your voice in the process. We need it, without all the heavy AI processing.

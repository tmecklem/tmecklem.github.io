title: "I'm becoming an author. I find that I'm writing down my thoughts, ideas, perspective, and rationale a lot more than I used to, because I know it will be read. Sometimes by people, other times by a computer that will use it for content that will be read by other people. It's interesting how powerful it is to know that your words will be seen and incorporated into outcomes you can't guess at yet."

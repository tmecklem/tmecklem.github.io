I have a few conference talks coming up, and among them is... #CodeMash 2023!

This is a talk about the convergence of event-driven backend systems meeting a frontend that shows intentional empathy toward the person's wants and needs who is using the application. It's about making tactical decisions to provide timely and relevant information in modern, capable web applications that are no longer constrained by the request-response lifecycles of the old web. And it's about making tech stack decisions that make the end-to-end experience more cohesive and much easier to build. Tickets go on sale this week at codemash.org. I hope you'll join me!

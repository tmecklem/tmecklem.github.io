One recurring piece of feedback for me from the conference talk on designing real-time web apps was "show me the code". The talk is focused on empathy, ux, team composition, and architectural choices. But I'm a software dev at heart, and I hear that loud and clear and want to turn the talk into a conversation. Would you prefer:

A) a livestream/series of twitch live-coding sessions with examples
B) a series of blog posts
C) an example site
D) A https://livebook.dev (think supercharged Jupyter notebooks with embedded docs and live code)
E) a mob pairing session

Or something else? (please comment with your idea)

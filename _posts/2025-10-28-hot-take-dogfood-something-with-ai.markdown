If you're a developer using AI, dogfood something. Build something end-to-end that solves your own problem (where you're the customer), and own it from first git commit through integration and deployment, over time. It's possible to do on the side, will help you level up, and you'll see where the cracks appear in using AI tools from a customer perspective. Push your knowledge of testing tools and automation and make the thing you build robust and reliable. Build the small affordances that make your life nicer. See what it's like on the other side of your dev environment. Then talk about it and share your experience with other people. There's a lot of joy in software beyond writing the code.

title: "The most important senior dev skills to build right now are a quick trigger finger to stop Claude, and the ability to read and grok copious amounts of code and keep the full mental model in view. Claude, Copilot, all of them, they're just bad at it still. But if you can limit WIP, review quickly, and learn to make yourself the smallest bottleneck possible, you can build ridiculous levels of production-quality features in a short amount of time. I just built what would have taken 3 weeks last year in about 2.5 work days. It's just incredible. Full test suite, continuous delivery, PII field level encryption, authentication and authorization, the works."

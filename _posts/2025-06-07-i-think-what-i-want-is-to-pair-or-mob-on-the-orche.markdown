I want to be in an immersive world with my colleagues, moving together to conduct an orchestra of tools while experiencing the joy of collaborating with humans in the work, synchronously."

I think what I want is to pair or mob on the orchestration of LLM tools. We've limited ourselves to projecting a new kind of work onto our old plane of working, and it's making us sad. I don't want to stare at a chat window and watch Claude have all the fun. I want to be in an immersive world with my colleagues, moving together to conduct an orchestra of tools while experiencing the joy of collaborating with humans in the work, synchronously.

I don't know if I've painted that picture vividly enough, but has anyone seen anyone trying to build this yet?

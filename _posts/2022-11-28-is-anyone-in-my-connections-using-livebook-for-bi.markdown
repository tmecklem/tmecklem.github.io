Is anyone in my connections using Livebook for BI? I'm getting good insights out of my work in it, and I'm thinking about the process of  sharing them internally (something that Livebook enterprise seems well suited for, whenever that ships). Eventually, I'm interested in incorporating the work into one of our homegrown internal apps as insights become more standardized reports. Anyone I know working or playing in this space?

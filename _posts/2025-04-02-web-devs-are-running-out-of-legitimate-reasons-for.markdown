Web devs are running out of legitimate reasons for why there isn't a comprehensive and automated test suite in the app that trigger on every PR... ðŸ˜…

We recently hit 94+% test coverage on a project that didn't have high historical coverage, "accidentally". This wasn't a concerted effort or even an explicit or stated goal. We didn't even begin measuring it until after we hit 94, we were just focusing on making sure new and changed things have quality automated tests. LLMs are making this so easy.

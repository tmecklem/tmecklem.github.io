title: "LLM prompts aren’t enough. If you want to get the best results out of your tools, you have to light up the runway so they can’t do anything but nail the landing. Adding solid tests and giving them bright signals *inside* the code, with strong patterns and techniques born from decades of experience in delivery… this is the way to win. The team at Launch Scout learned this about prompts early on and we’ve been pushing deeper for a few months now, with great results. In some cases, we are enabling “one shot” features by non-devs on the team. This ain’t vibe coding, it’s fully baked, fully tested, fully integrated production-shippable work out of the gate."

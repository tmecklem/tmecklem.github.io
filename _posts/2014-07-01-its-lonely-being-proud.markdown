As a developer, I've gained a reputation for tackling technical problems that require depth. If a problem looks like a ball of yarn, send me in. I'll tease it apart and keep hold of the thread until there's nothing left to explore. This is often a useful trait, but just as often it's left me in the dark without any clear direction where to go next.

The real problem is that I don't recognize the right time to step back and ask for help. I'm too proud. I am surrounded by very intelligent, perceptive people. They sense when I've gone down another rabbit hole and try to pull me out. (Thanks Bill W. especially for being the first usually to identify it).

Monday morning I walked into my team standup feeling overwhelmed. I have a performance problem in the jvm-deployed version of a Rails app, a set of advanced queries that need to be written to pull back insightful information efficiently, and a bunch of outstanding features that need to be implemented for an upcoming alpha release of a new product. Before the meeting, I was pulling at too many difficult threads at once and making no progress on anything.

During standup, I recognized that I was in over my head and asked for help.

I'm trusting the team to handle the first two tasks while I focus on the third. It's difficult for me to let go, even though I know I can't complete everything myself. I can't explain why I have such a problem with this. When I don't ask for help, I end up lonely and defeated.

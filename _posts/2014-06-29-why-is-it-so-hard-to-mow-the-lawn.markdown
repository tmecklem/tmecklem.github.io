I hate lawn maintenance. Who seriously likes walking back and forth in rows, doing the same stupid thing over and over? Why do people subject themselves to this insanity? 

I'm a maker by nature; and I'm a fixer. I take things that don't exist or don't work right and I make them function. Yard work is neither. It's maintenance, and I'm not wired for it. 

We have dogs that add patches of nitrogen-rich grass everywhere. The grass grows too long and then I have to mow down a hay field instead of a lawn. I end up with those embarrassing strips of mulched, dried grass. My mower protests the injustice of it all for everyone to hear. It's a walk of shame, and my neighbors are always out on their decks when I find time to do the job. I even punish myself by fertilizing and spraying weed killer and over-seeding.

But something is happening as I mature. Call it senility, but I'm starting to appreciate the ritual of maintenance activities. When I allow myself time to go through familiar motions, my mind relaxes from the constant churn of trying to outdo yesterday. 

But if you're hoping I start a lawn care company with my newfound respect, don't hold your breath.

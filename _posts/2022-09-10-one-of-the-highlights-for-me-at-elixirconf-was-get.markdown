One of the highlights for me at ElixirConf was getting to hang out with the fine folks at Binary Noggin, and specifically with Amos King. Amos and crew are mighty fine Elixirists and have contributed much to the Elixir ecosystem. So today, as Chris Nelson and I attended our Cincinnati aspiring web developers meetup to mentor aspiring devs, I treated today like itâ€™s #nogginday.

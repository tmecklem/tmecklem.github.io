title: "Let's meet up! I would like to compare notes with anyone leading a team of developers using (or thinking about using AI). I want to have as many conversations about it as I can, because we're in a high potential but generally low-information/experience point in the industry and there's a lot to be learned from each other. Reply with \"meet\" or DM me if you're interested and I'll send a calendly link (also happy to buy you a coffee if you're in the Cincinnati area)."

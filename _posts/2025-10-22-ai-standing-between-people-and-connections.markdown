AI has an important role to play, but standing in the middle of people and connections is not one of them for me.

Over the last year or so, my family has made a habit out of watching Instagram together on the couch and laughing at the same cat videos, seeing certain producers share their lives, and we've bonded over silly Gen Z slang. The last month, it has become markedly sadder. More and more videos are clearly AI generated. Worse, others _probably_ became AI videos but the signs are harder to tell. If this is really the future of social media platforms, to be filled with content by AI, I think I'm just going to have to opt out entirely of most of it. I wish LinkedIn was above this, but it's one of the worst offenders.

On the flip side, in-person networking and connection is largely unaffected by this, and I've really enjoyed those events and connections more than ever. More of that, please.

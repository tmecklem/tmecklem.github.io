What is a problem you encounter frequently that makes you think, “this should be easy, why is it so hard that nobody has solved it yet?”

For me, it was the automatic renewal of a subscription I meant to cancel (but couldn’t immediately due to some seriously dark UX patterns). I thought, “why isn’t there a service that I can use to automatically identify recurring charges from a heuristic in the transaction, that can remind about it before they try to charge me a ‘nonrefundable’ fee?” Then I saw an ad for something like that product the next day 😂

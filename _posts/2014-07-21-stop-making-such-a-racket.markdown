A long time ago I filed away the old adage, "the mind has a strong influence over the body" as one of those theoretical axioms that just sounds right. I assumed it meant that if you practice hard, you'll become good at playing the trumpet. I wish I'd seen the direct link more quickly.

I don't really know how any of the following ties together, so I've laid it out chronologically.

During the Worry-fest of 2013 (see [here]({% post_url 2014-06-24-in-my-brokenness-complete %}) for context), I developed a deep bitter feeling in the pit of my stomach. I don't mean that in a literary sense. I physically became a container of ill feeling. I didn't have some of the typical IBS symptoms like nausea or vomiting, but I constantly felt miserable. This continued from late summer into winter.

Some time in October, I also developed an esophageal ulcer when some medication didn't make it all the way into my stomach before activating. I had an endoscopy performed in November, and it was my first time undergoing general anesthesia and the forget-me-now drugs. The ulcer had healed completely and there were no other causes for concern, so the GI doc sent me on my way. I hoped the procedure would shed light on my stomach irritation, so I was disappointed when there wasn't a definitive answer. I cut back on milk, suspecting a lactose intolerance due to family history. My stomach trouble seemed to subside with dietary changes, but it never entirely disappeared without medication.

In early January, I developed a ringing tinnitus in alternating ears once every few days. It started out slowly. Two or three seconds of a loud ringing on one ear, and after a minute everything was fine again. I had several bouts of lightheadedness during a software conference, but never vertigo or disorientation.

The first Saturday in March, I spent the entire day dragging my body from one place to lay down to another. I assumed it was just a bad day for my stomach, but as the evening wore on the pain changed from a general ill feeling to a sharp pain in my lower right abdomen. I started thinking it might be my appendix. I tried to cope until morning, but I reached a breaking point in the middle of the night and had to be hauled to the hospital in an ambulance. The surgeon removed my appendix that day and I was released around 2pm on Sunday. This was my first surgery and the second time in 4 months that I was put under. The pain meds and recovery from anesthesia caused me hallucinations that were vivid and began right where consciousness left off. It was terrifying. I had to stop the heavy stuff and drop to ibuprofen.

For the next few months, I woke up periodically in the middle of the night in cold sweats similar to what happened when I had appendicitis. I now believe those to have been a result of subjecting my compromised body to the surgery and endoscopy and pain meds. Nevertheless, it triggered a deep feeling of anxiety in me and I began to experience several other physical responses to the anxiety. It wasn't until I began to become accustomed to the night sweats that I was able to separate out the anxiety-based responses.

Sometime in May, the tinnitus began to transform. The ringing was still occurring, and I also began to have a feeling like I'd been in the pool and needed to drain my ear. Everything I tried wouldn't clear it. I'm not prone to ear infections. Popping my ears to equalize pressure comes naturally, but that didn't help the fluid or feeling of fullness. I visited my PCP, an ENT, and a chiropractic neurologist and I'm still hoping to find a diagnosis or at least relief. It has affected my vestibular system, but not in a dramatic way. The strangest symptom (and also the source for the title of this post) is something called hyperacusis. Every little noise makes me jump when this heightened sound sensitivity is occurring.

I've experienced no hearing loss yet. The possibilities for my ears range from allergies or a sinus infection that's clogging my Eustachian tubes to something called a perilymph fistula (which could be the onset of Maniere's disease). Or it could be something more exotic.

I keep waking up wondering if this will be the day where I get to put all of this in the rear-view and go back to being "normal". Or maybe this will be the day where I definitively learn that this is the new normal. For now, I deeply appreciate the good days. I hope strongly that no new weird things will happen until I figure out the old weird things, and I look forward to closure.

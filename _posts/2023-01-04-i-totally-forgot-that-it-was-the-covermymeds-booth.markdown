I totally forgot that it was the CoverMyMeds booth that I won a drone from at #codemash like 8-ish years ago. I repaired some things on it over the break and my son and I played with it outside for a while again. What a fun gift that's weathered the years.

I'll be back at CodeMash this year as a speaker. If you've never been, check it out. The hallway track is unlike any other conference I've attended.

Thank you again, CMM!

**Published:** 21 January 2025
**Author:** Tim Mecklem

## Overview

Tim Mecklem shares a pragmatic perspective on AI tools, writing from the viewpoint of a former AI skeptic. The blog post explores practical applications of AI technology across different domains.

## Key Practical Suggestions for AI Tool Usage

### 1. Summarizing Articles
- Use ChatGPT to get a quick overview of content
- Helpful for pre-scanning articles and getting a "second opinion"
- Can use development tools like Cursor to summarize codebases

### 2. Meeting Notes
- Utilize AI notetaking tools like fathom.video
- Allows simultaneous participation and documentation
- Recommend getting participant permission first

### 3. Communication Analysis
- Use AI to analyze tone, body language, and message effectiveness
- Ask open-ended questions like:
  - "What are the primary takeaways from this message?"
  - "How will the intended audience likely receive it?"

### 4. Media File Organization
- Generate summaries for notes, audio files, and videos
- Recommended technique: Use Whisper for transcription, then AI for summarization

## Conclusion

Mecklem emphasizes that AI tools are not a replacement for critical thinking but can be valuable assistive technologies when used pragmatically.

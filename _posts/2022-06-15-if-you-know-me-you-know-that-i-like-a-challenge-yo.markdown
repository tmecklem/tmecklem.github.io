If you know me, you know that I like a challenge. You also know that I hate throwing away engineered products. I love the challenge of fixing them and giving them new life. I’ve soldered new capacitors on a TV, fixed this little Breville Barista Express (pictured) countless times and again today, soldered components on prototype boards to add functionality to existing stuff, and with our new house on 5 acres I’m picking up a deeper understanding of small engine repair (and employing a lot of applied physics to problems that are an order of magnitude larger than things we encountered at the old house).

This is partly why I love Launch Scout so much. The whole team loves challenges that require curiosity and that stretch us in new ways. I appreciate this company and my team so much.

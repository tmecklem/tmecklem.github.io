Pulse check.

If I did the math on it, this week would be near the top in terms of the amount I built, both internally and on client projects. I think I touched the editor pane maybe 10 times. It’s a failure mode at this point. Feelings about that aside, this is the reality lately. And the quality of the code hasn’t dropped. If anything, it’s higher coverage and better edge case testing. And so much code reading and rejecting. I don’t know where all this is going, but this is where I am.

Is this crazy to you? Does it resonate? What is your current experience with the tools relative to what I see?

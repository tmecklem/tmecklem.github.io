My time and my experience from 2025, shared freely with you.

This has been true for a while, but maybe not as clearly stated as this. If you are a human, doing business around Cincinnati, and you are wondering about all the things I’ve been talking about recently… you can just message me and we can go drink coffee somewhere and talk about it 1-1, no underhanded sales gimmicks or hooks. I’ve done it several dozen times this year, and anyone who has gone through it is free to reply in the comments and share your experience you had with me during our 1-1 time, positive or negative. In fact, I invite you to. I care about you all and want you to succeed, just like I hope you do for me.

There are a lot of people talking about LLM and AI business tools. Most are using the tools at a transactional level (load up this app, enter this prompt, get this output to copy and paste somewhere else), or they are geeked out about the technical details and don’t quite know how to capture the business application potential. I have to straddle both business and technical in my role, and I’ve made it my journey to understand and apply both as effectively as I can this year. And as much as I hate talking about myself like this, I’ve become very effective at it.

These aren’t my consulting secrets that I’m holding close to my vest. I’m an open book, in part because there’s “real work” involved in making them systemic and actionable tools, and most people will need help getting there even with a well-articulated plan freely shared. I’ll show you how I’m using them right now, and then you have to decide whether you want to stay where you have been or take the same kind of steps that I have. That’s just the reality of 2025. Message me if you’re curious.

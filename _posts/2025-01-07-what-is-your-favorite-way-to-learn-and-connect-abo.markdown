What is your favorite way to learn and connect about technical things? I've been thinking about my own habits recently, and I realized that while I still prefer to read long form articles, I've gotten more accustomed to short videos as well.

I still don't like when I'm looking for something specific and it's 45 minutes into a 2 hour YouTube. I'm hopeful that some of the AI summarization tools will help with that problem soon and maybe extract the key pars of the video into a tailored article for what I need.

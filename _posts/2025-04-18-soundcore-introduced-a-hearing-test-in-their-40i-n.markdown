Soundcore introduced a hearing test in their 40i noise cancellation/transparency product. It tweaks the EQ to account for your perception of different frequencies so that what you hear is more accurate for the actual environmental loudness. Sometimes "small" advancements like this in consumer products blow my mind and make me grateful to be alive now. It reminded me of the Safewave Technology band and how they're similarly improving peoples' lives with innovative technology.

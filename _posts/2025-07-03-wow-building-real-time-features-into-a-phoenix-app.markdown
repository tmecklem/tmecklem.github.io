Wow. Building real-time features into a Phoenix application using Cursor is incredible.

Since LiveView arrived on the scene, it's always been "batteries included", but you still had to put the batteries in the correct way. Today, I was able to say, "make this part of the screen update in real time when the data changes in the backend" and it wired up the liveview component, the pubsub, and modified the business logic to publish the event. It hot code reloaded and the screen was suddenly live and realtime where it used to be one-time rendered. And it wrote decent tests!

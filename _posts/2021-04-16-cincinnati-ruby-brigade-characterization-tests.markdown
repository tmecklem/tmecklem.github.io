During the April 2021 meeting of the Cincinnati Ruby Brigade, I discussed writing Characterization tests for legacy codebases, inspired by Michael Feathers' book "Working Effectively with Legacy Code". This technique helps systematically document and understand existing code behavior through testing, especially in complex or poorly documented legacy systems.

# Cincinnati Ruby Brigade: Characterization Tests

**Published:** 16 April 2021
**Author:** Bill Barnett

During the April 2021 meeting of the Cincinnati Ruby Brigade, Tim Mecklem from Gaslight discussed writing Characterization tests for legacy codebases, inspired by Michael Feathers' book "Working Effectively with Legacy Code".

## Characterization Testing Process

1. Use code in a test harness (RSpec)
2. Write an assertion that will fail
3. Let the failure reveal the actual behavior
4. Update the test to match the code's behavior
5. Repeat the process

The key approach is to systematically document and understand existing code behavior through testing, especially in complex or poorly documented legacy systems.

The full code example is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/cincinnatirb/fizzbuzz).

**Note:** This article references the Gaslight team, which has since rebranded as Launch Scout.

The blog post is part of Launch Scout's development blog, focusing on software development techniques and insights from their team's experiences.

Requesting a test subject! Do you have a problem in your daily work that you wish was solved (and you believe could be solved with the right software?)

I want to try something a little new for me that's somewhere at the intersection of improv and project discovery. It's probably not going to work, but it _might_ and it could be fun. And it's free, so there's that. If you want to know more, let me know... or just book some time and we'll see where it goes: https://lnkd.in/eWskvqAP
